<h1>CS344 Website</h1>

<h3>This is the Repo for Group 1's website</h3>
<hr>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>We implemented a clean, simple main page with a link for Faculty, and dummy links for Current Students and Prospective students. We added a styled faculty page with a clean and consistent design.  Headers and footers were separated into different files and included so that they were consistent across every page. Our pages resize responsively and our layout is easy to use and understand.</p>
<p>The website was a group project to create a prototype website for the Winona State Computer Science Department. This was made for the Fall 2016 section of CS 344 - Web Programming at Winona State.</p>
